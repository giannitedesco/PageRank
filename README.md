PageRank
========

The code associated with iainkfrasers #sundayfun article 2. It implements a trivial PageRank 
algorithm. It is unrealistic because 

1) It uses adjacency matrices 

2) Matrices are in RAM

3) No optimisations on matrix/vector operations ( e.g. cache oblivious from #sundayfun #article1 )

Having said that, it has the PageRank implementation and the plain eigenvector algorithm for
homogeneous Markov chains.
